# Hamburger Flutter
App concept created with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) inspired by [Tasty Burger](https://dribbble.com/shots/4038053-Tasty-Burger-App). 

## About
The app was created to simulate all the system behind the inspiration video. There's no code on backend or other web service. The app is all contained in this repository. The models classes was created to better representate an official development, the repositories classes are simulating a web request. I'm using BLOC pattern as architectural pattern.

### Notes
This code was build in a few hours within 3 days, so there's still some small things to complete. There's no Cart, Profile, or Favorite screen on the inspiration video, so i created the Cart screen myself.
